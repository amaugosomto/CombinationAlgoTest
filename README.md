# CombinationAlgoTest

## Count candidates

=============
Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique
combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.
The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times.
Write a function solution(c, t) that receives a set of candidates c and target value t and returns
all unique combinations.
> Note:

1. All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
2. The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

## Test Cases

=========

`Input: solution([2,3,6,7], 7)
Output:
[
[7],
[2,2,3]
]
Input: solution([2,3,5], 8)
Output:
[
[2,2,2,2],
[2,3,3],
[3,5]
]`

Constraints

=========
● 1 <= candidates.length <= 30
● 1 <= candidates[i] <= 200
● Each element of the candidate is unique.
● 1 <= target <= 500
● Result should be on a private personal github and share
● Only standard libraries of chosen programming languages could be used
● Time for solving task is 2 hours
